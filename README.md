# api-client

This script is a command line tool to parse test file with a set of command to be executed via the Hiring Api. To run the script, simply type 
<code> php client.php api-commands.txt</code> feel free to change the  api-commands.txt content or pass in another text file and run the command again. I have also added PHPUnit tests in tests/testHiringAPIClient.php . You can run the tests by entering the command <code> phpunit tests/testHiringAPIClient.php</code> but you will have to have PHPUnit installed on your system first.
